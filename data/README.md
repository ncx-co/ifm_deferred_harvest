## growth_by_fldgrpcd

NCX takes the forest type that an FIA field crew assigns during measurement visits, and relabels them using broader groups of forest types. Within the FIA database, FORTYPCD and FLDTYPCD represent the same hierarchy of forest classification. They differ in how they are determined: FLDTYPCD (2.5.17) is assigned during the inventory visit by the USFS field foresters, FORTYPCD (2.5.16) is an algorithmic classification generated after the inventory. NCX derived a new categorical variable, FLDGRPCD, which is the field-assigned equivalent of TYPGRPCD. FLDGRPCD is determined by matching each FLDTYPCD record with the parent TYPGRPCD found in Appendix D of "The Forest Inventory and Analysis Database: Database Description and User Buide for Phase 2 (version 9.0). 

These are the descriptions of the column headers:
- fldgrpcd: Field group code, defined the same as USFS type group code
- annual_agb_recruitment_prop: median annual change in biomass due to recruitment of new stems
- annual_agb_mortality_prop: median annual change in biomass due to non-harvest mortality
- annual_agb_removal_prop: median annual change in biomass due to harvest
- mean_annual_growth_carbon_tons_per_ac_pct: median annual change in biomass due to growth on surviving stems
- annual_agb_net_change_prop: median annual net change in aboveground biomass
- the remaining columns match the above description but with 'sound volume' replacing 'biomass'. These are used as a proxy to estimate change in stand value
